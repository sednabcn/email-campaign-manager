Key Technical Achievements
Core System Architecture

Multi-Source Data Integration: Engineered robust data loading pipelines supporting CSV, Excel (XLSX/XLS), DOCX, and real-time Google Sheets API integration with automatic validation and normalization
Template Processing Engine: Developed advanced DOCX parsing with dynamic variable substitution ({{name}}, {{email}}, {{organization}}), enabling personalized content at scale
Compliance Framework: Implemented GDPR/CAN-SPAM compliant rate limiting system with daily caps, per-domain throttling, automated suppression list management, and unsubscribe handling

CI/CD & Automation

GitHub Actions Workflows: Architected sophisticated multi-stage pipeline with enhanced validation, queue-based email batch processing, and comprehensive artifact management
Queue-Based Architecture: Designed decoupled email generation and sending system, enabling reliable batch processing with configurable rate limits and retry mechanisms
Automated Testing: Implemented pre-flight validation, SMTP connection testing, and DOCX file integrity verification with auto-repair capabilities

Advanced Features

Campaign Isolation & Tracking: Built domain-specific tracking system with isolated campaign execution, comprehensive analytics, and automated contact archiving post-campaign
Reply & Feedback System: Integrated IMAP-based reply tracking, automated feedback injection, and real-time response monitoring with sentiment analysis capabilities
Multi-Mode Execution: Supported immediate, scheduled, and schedule_now campaign modes with date-based validation and priority queue management

Compliance & Security

Suppression Management: Automated unsubscribe request processing with JSONL audit logging and token-based verification system
Rate Limiting: Intelligent throttling with per-domain limits (5), daily caps (configurable), and automatic reset on date rollover
Data Protection: Implemented contact data archiving, tracking isolation by campaign ID, and comprehensive audit trails

Technical Implementation Highlights

Error Handling: Production-grade error recovery with detailed diagnostics, corrupted DOCX repair utilities, and graceful degradation
